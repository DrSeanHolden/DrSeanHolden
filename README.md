<p>Hi, I’m @DrSeanHolden.</p>

<p>I'm University Associate Professor of Computer Science at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge.</p>

<p>I’m interested in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, and particularly in applying them to Automated Theorem Proving.</p>

<p>More detail than you can handle on my <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sbh11">Web Site</a>.</p>
